**An infinite, zoomable workspace for your *real, running* apps.** Not
screenshots, not thumbnails — the live windows themselves. Zoom out to see
everything at once, zoom in to teleport into the actual window and work, pull
back with a thumb button. Then annotate the whole thing like a whiteboard.

> Think *Stage Manager / Mission Control*, but on an **infinite 2D canvas with
> persistent positions** — plus a FigJam-style layer (sticky notes, zone frames,
> connector arrows) drawn directly on top of your live apps.

## Quick start

Requires **Windows 10 1903+ / Windows 11**. Single file, no installer, no
.NET / VC redistributable.

1. **[Download the latest `.zip`](https://github.com/13auth/spatial-canvas/releases/latest)** → extract.
2. Run `SpatialCanvas.exe`. The canvas opens and captures your open windows.
3. Press **ESC** to exit — everything returns exactly where it was. First launch
   shows a 3-line tip card; **F1** lists every shortcut.

> The build is unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may say "unknown publisher" →
> *More info → Run anyway*. The UI is English by default (switch to Turkish in
> **Settings → Language**).

## Why

More windows than monitors? Instead of alt-tab roulette or a third screen, lay
everything out **spatially** on one canvas and rely on muscle memory for *where*
things are. Built for people who juggle many live windows at once — developers
with a wall of terminals/editors, researchers with a dozen PDFs and docs,
anyone who thinks better in 2D space than in a taskbar.

The key difference from a normal "zoom out" view: the tiles are **live and
interactive after you dive in**. Cross the zoom threshold (or double-click) and
the real window snaps under your cursor with focus — **no input simulation, no
screenshot proxy.** Pull back and it parks again, textures still live.

## Features

- 🪟 **Spaces (multiple canvases)** — virtual-desktop-style spaces (`Ctrl+T` new,
  `Ctrl+Tab` switch). Each keeps its own windows, camera, and notes/zones; the same
  window can live on several spaces, each at its own position (`Ctrl+Alt+1..9`).
  Top switcher strip (`[1][2][3] [+] [×]`); persists across restarts.
- 🔦 **Focus mode** — `Ctrl+Shift+D` dims everything but the window/app under the
  cursor (or your selection), so one context stands out in a wall of windows.
- 🗺️ **Infinite zoomable canvas** — cursor-focused zoom, momentum pan, edge
  auto-pan, world-anchored dot grid. Windows keep fixed world positions.
- 🪂 **Park & Swap dive** — zoom in to enter the real `HWND`; thumb-button (or
  `Ctrl+Alt+Z`) to pull back to the same view.
- 🧭 **Find your way** — `Ctrl+F` search (windows, notes, zones), minimap with
  click-to-jump and drag-to-pan, bookmarks (`Ctrl+1–4`), keyboard navigation.
- 🧩 **Spatial-thinking layer** — sticky **notes** (`Ctrl+Shift+N`), labeled
  **zone frames** that group and tidy the windows inside them (`Ctrl+Shift+Z`),
  and **connector arrows** between windows (`Ctrl+drag`). Undo with `Ctrl+Z`.
- 🚀 **Launch without leaving** — right-edge app dock (real icons) and a
  `Ctrl+N` command palette.
- 📌 **Pin, duplicate, arrange** — pin a window as a screen-fixed HUD
  (`Ctrl+P`), duplicate (`Ctrl+C/V`), and arrange into a grid (`Ctrl+G`).
- 💾 **Remembers everything** — per-window layout, notes, zones, bookmarks, and
  settings persist across sessions.

## How it works

There is **no input simulation** and **no screenshot proxy**. Three layers:

1. **Capture** — a Windows.Graphics.Capture session per window (FreeThreaded
   FramePool, poll-based, lock-free). Frames are copied into persistent D3D11
   textures.
2. **Canvas** — a borderless fullscreen D3D11 swapchain; each window is a
   1:1-pixel quad in world space. A D2D/DWrite overlay draws title labels, hover
   highlight, the dot grid, docks, notes, zones, and connectors.
3. **Park & Swap** — windows "park" in a 2px visible strip at the bottom of the
   primary monitor, so occlusion throttling never fires and textures stay live.
   Cross the zoom threshold and the real `HWND` teleports onto the quad and takes
   focus; pull back and it returns to the park strip.

In canvas mode the window is TOPMOST and the taskbar is hidden; diving into a
window drops it to the normal z-order and brings the taskbar back.

<details>
<summary><b>Resilience</b> — what happens on crash, device loss, logoff…</summary>

- **Single instance:** a mutex; a second launch brings the existing canvas to front.
- **Crash insurance:** park state is written to `pending_restore.txt`; a crash
  filter (`SetUnhandledExceptionFilter`) instantly re-shows the taskbar and
  un-parks windows. The next launch also restores stranded windows (matched by
  HWND/exe/title).
- **Device loss:** TDR / driver update / sleep-wake → D3D/D2D/WGC fully rebuilt;
  if that fails, windows are restored and the app exits cleanly (none left
  orphaned in the 2px strip).
- **Resolution/DPI change:** geometry, swapchain, and the park strip rebuild live.
- **Session end:** `WM_QUERYENDSESSION`/`WM_ENDSESSION` → windows return, taskbar
  comes back.
- **explorer.exe restart:** `TaskbarCreated` is observed and the new taskbar is
  hidden again.
- **Lifecycle:** tiles of closed windows are cleaned up; a window whose capture
  died but is still alive is returned, not left parked.

**Performance:** doesn't burn the GPU when idle — the main loop draws only when
something changes (dirty flag + `MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx`). The dot grid uses
a single wrap-mode bitmap brush; overlay brushes are cached.

<details>
<summary><b>Config files</b> — settings, launcher, window rules</summary>

All under `%APPDATA%\SpatialCanvas\`:

- **`settings.txt`** — language, update check, capture FPS (15/30/60), animation
  speed, labels, dive threshold, max window count, background tone, dot grid,
  start-with-Windows, canvas area (primary / all monitors). Edit in-app via the
  **⚙** panel.
- **`launcher.txt`** — app-dock shortcuts as `Label|program|arguments` (a sample
  template is created on first launch; the right-edge **+** button adds entries
  for you).
- **`rules.txt`** — an `exclude=app.exe` line never captures that exe (commented
  template created on first launch).

> **Update check** (on by default) fetches a small version file from GitHub on
> launch and shows a notification if a newer release exists — notification only,
> nothing is downloaded or installed. Turn it off in Settings.
